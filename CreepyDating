#Program Goal: program that provides guidance on whether a particular person on whether or not they should date a specific other person of a certain age

#Ask the user for their age and the significant other's age
userAge = int(input("Enter your age: "))
loverAge = int(input("Enter your significant other's age: "))

#Calculates the age range the user is allowed to date
youngest = userAge/2 + 7
oldest = (userAge - youngest)  * 3 + youngest

#Determine if the significant other fits into the user's age range
if (youngest <= loverAge <= oldest):
    print("Go for it! It's socially acceptable!")
else:
    print("Don't even try. It's creepy")
